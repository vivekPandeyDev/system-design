## To implement Open/Closed Principle (OCP) we can use:

### 1. **Abstraction**
- Define abstract classes or interfaces to represent common behavior, allowing new functionality to be added without modifying existing code.

### 2. **Inheritance**
- Extend existing classes to add new behavior while keeping the original class unchanged, promoting code reuse.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
- Use method overriding or interface implementation to handle new cases dynamically, enabling the system to work with new types without changing existing code.
